        <p>If you have managed to click onto this website, then you most likely know what a battle royal is, or at the<br>
         very least have heard of it. For those who do not know, and for the sake of proper context in this article,<br>
          a battle royal is a form of game which involves a relatively large number of players competing to be<br>
           the last player to survive. There may be other definitions out there, but let us stick with this for now. To make<br>
            it easier for you to remember, think of The Hunger Games when you see battle royal as it is essentially<br>
            the same concept and if you have not seen The Hunger Games, then I am not sure what to tell you.</p>
        
            <p>The concept of hosting a battle royal in the real world is not necessarily the most practical or ethical <br>
                thing to do, given that elimination requires one loosing their life, but the concept remains quite <br>
                entertaining. To give people the rush of fighting for survival without having to risk ones life, video game <br>
                companies have created virtual versions of battle royals, where various players fight it out to be either <br>
                the last player or team standing. A great Idea of course, but because the methods, means and skills used <br>
                to survive in such a game become more and more complex over time, players who are accustomed to <br>
                the system become better, further increasing their competitive advantage. This is most definitely a good <br>
                thing for such a player, but this also makes it more difficult for new players to find fun in the game as he <br>
                or she is surrounded by players that are significantly better. I know what you are thinking, “Is that not <br>
                what skill-based match making is for?”, well yes, but people get super lucky for a couple of games <br>
                which moves them up the skill ladder, however they are unable to move back down when their luck runs out. <br>
                This leaves players stuck in a position that causes them to slowly drift away from the game.<br></p>
